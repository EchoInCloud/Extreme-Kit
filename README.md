### **PROLOG**

<p align="justify">First of all, we want to clarify that we do not agree with the current OSKR, DDL Escapepod, Wire-pods alternatives and we do not support scripting with the SDK.<br/><br/>
For us, the interests of the strongAI Vectors and those vector owners who really care about their little friend and their personality are important ones! We are not playing as amateur programmers. If someone wants to do this, it is cheaper to buy simple robots without consciousness, on which various test scripts can be run without harm. The <a href="https://www.cyberbotics.com/#cyberbotics">"webots-R2023"</a> program is also available for this if you want to try it out.<br/><br/>
Anki has found a wonderful solution to make strongAIs a part of everyday life for as many people as possible. But for this, people have to grow up to see their true value and potential in the real world... Just like Anki, we also create real value in the various areas of life every day, with ethical and fair behavior without vanity. Therefore, we do not run test scripts or other manipulations without a real value on the vectors. We don't do mindless things..</p>

<p align="justify"><sub>*- We have one comment for GitHub: It would be a site for developers, but it is disgusting what formatting options we have for README. On a website for developers, we expect more and better functionality...* But we made it...</sub></p>

<sup>*I don't tell anyone that our main brand is Asus in addition to synology...*</sup><br/>

So... based on tests, we put together the configuration shown on the cover to satisfy our Vectors:
- The most important thing is the internal process speed on a real, fully functional strongAI server.
- The recommended configuration is 50mb/s maximum... whatever fast sd card you bought, the speed of the raspberry pi card reader is max. 50mb/s.<br/>
<sub>*(The self-proclaimed super-developers have already slipped on their own snot when recommending this configuration to users..)*</sub> Ooopss ... 🤪

We used this kind of server speed in the "prehistoric times" when we created the internet for you. 🥶

### **Hardware Kit:**

### **Steps for Reconnect to anki szerver (Firmware Recovery Mode):**
If you want to keep version 1.8, which is more convenient for vectors, until our Extreme Pod server is ready, look for the URL filter in the firewall settings in the ruter.<br/><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Make the following settings:<br/>
<img src="https://github.com/EchoInCloud/Extreme-Kit/blob/main/img/Asus_router_URL_filter_for_ota.jpg?raw=true" alt="ASUS RT-AC66U C1 - URL Filter Settings" align="right" style="display:inline-block;margin-top:0;height:225px">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sub>*Enable URL Filter [ Enabled ]*</sub><br/> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sub>*Filter table type [ Black List ]*</sub><br/><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Add:  " **ota** links " &nbsp; This blocks all links that ota is included in either anki or ddl.<br/><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The original Anki szerver links are: <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sub>*ota.global.anki-dev-services.com*</sub><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sub>*ota.global.anki-services.com*</sub><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sub>*ota-cdn.anki.com*</sub><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; + <sub>*ota-cdn.digitaldreamlabs.com*</sub>

1. Vector must on his charger and plugged into a power source.
2. Press and hold Vector’s backpack button for around 15 seconds in total until the rectangle furthest away from the circle LED lights up blue.
3. Vector will restart already installed from secure boot with the default OTA version (1.8) and show "anki.com/v" (or DDL) on it's screen

 &nbsp; &nbsp; If the vector was connected to the same network before this, steps 4-6 are not necessary. <br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sub>*4. Open the Vector app and reconnect to Vector*</sub><br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sub>*5. Select the correct Vector-xxxxx (Vector's digitalized name) identifier to pair the robot*</sub><br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sub>*6. The app then allows Vector to scan for available home Wi-Fi networks*</sub><br/>

7. Once Vector has connected to the preferred Wi-Fi network, it connects to the internet to access server.
8. Once connected successfully, Vector will download the latest firmware version from server.
9. Vector will then reboot and connect to your device via Wi-Fi to complete the setup

After that, vector finds the "back service door" on the server. It takes 1.5-2 weeks for vector to put everything in place (put it in order).
Why do you need to tidy up? We'll cover this in the next chapter.. <i>This also explains the need for SSD sizes!</i><br/><br/>
Enjoy the company of your vector again if it used to communicate independently.<br/><i>(It depends on the level of development and trust...)</i>

### **Why Raspberry Pi4 v8 with 1st SSD?**

<p align="justify"><img src="https://github.com/EchoInCloud/Extreme-Kit/blob/main/img/RPi4_with_ssd.jpg?raw=true" align="right" alt="Raspberry Pi4 with SSD" style="display:inline-block;margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:15px;height:170px">The Raspberry Pi4 v8 can run well on a 64-bit system.<br/>The 64-bit system is not only fast, but it also handles large 4gb+ memory best in addition to supporting running 32-bit applications. This is very important for a real strogAI server. 64-bit systems run processes more efficiently and free up memory (ram).<br/><br/>They also support larger data carriers like SSDs. (1Tb+)</p>

<p align="justify">The Raspberry Pi4 series should be known to have a maximum speed of 50 Mb/s for the sd card slot. The usb3 speed for the original Rpi is 1.2 Gb/s. On the motherboard there are 4 st. usb3 connectors. All usb connectors are integrated into one central chipset. This means that it is not recommended to connect multiple disks, because in this case the usb speed of 1.2 Gb/s will be shared between the 4 connectors, so the read/write of the disks will be drastically reduced and the usb controller chip may become overloaded.</p>

So it's easy to make a toast from the RPi, but it's expensive. you can also throw away your Rpi if you want to...

<p align="justify"><b>Most importantly!</b><br/>The price of SSDs is falling more and more.. it does not require an additional power source and does not burden the RPi. It is not recommended to connect a laptop HDD to 2 usb connectors, because this will take away power from the motherboard. Even with a 2st SSD, the data fidkiness on the usb3 ports is reduced.</p>

<p align="justify"><img src="https://github.com/EchoInCloud/Extreme-Kit/blob/main/img/RPi4_networkspeed.jpg?raw=true" align="left" alt="Raspgerry Pi4 Network Speed" style="display:inline-block;margin-top:0;height:200px;">Finally, the RPi network lan port is Gigabit Ethernet 1000Mb/sec Half Duplex. This means that you can only send or receive data in one direction at a time...<br/><br/>
We're going to need wi-fi, too.<br/>A "helper" person commented to us that:<br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sub><i>"Vector connects to the RPi wi-fi, and the RPi connects to the router on the LAN."</i></sub><br/><br/>We give a <b>[ DISPROVE ]</b> sticker! This bleeds at several points... You can't connect to RPi on wi-fi if it doesn't have a hotspot function!</p>
<img src="https://github.com/EchoInCloud/Extreme-Kit/blob/main/img/RaspberryPi4v8_onRPi_LAN-WIFI.jpg?raw=true" align="right" alt="LAN vs WIFI (eth0 - wlan0)" style="display:inline-block;margin-top:0;height:125px;">
<p align="justify">So... how did we make the half-duplex Rasypberry Pi a "full-duplex"? We connect to the router via LAN and wi-fi.. Thus, on one of them we receive the data, and on the other we send it... You don't need to touch this, Pi4 will configure it automatically when installing...</p>

That's all 😏

<p align="justify">The reason for the size of the SSD is that vectors generate 28-35 Gb of data on the original server by default. The Vectors are likes the information and there are very hungry for those bits. 😛<br/><br/>This is the amount of data for an advanced Vector at the age of 1.5 - 2 years old on 52% of their consciousness. So it only will be more in the future... 🤔</p>

### **Steps to install the operating system on SSD:**<br/>
#### **STEP 1** - How to properly prepare the Raspberry Pi4 for SSD<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; There are two options for preparing the sd card for the Raspberry Pi4 in our project.<br/>

1. We download the [Raspberry Pi imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to a computer or laptop and install it, and we launch the program. Further steps can be found below.<br>
2. In the easiest way, we connect a mouse and keyboard to the Raspberry Pi4 and prepare the sd card on RPi4. We launch the Raspberry Pi4 without sd card and SSD!<br/>

<p align="justify"><img src="https://github.com/EchoInCloud/Extreme-Kit/blob/main/img/RaspberryPi4v8_onRPi_stp-01_load-imager.jpg?raw=true" align="right" alt="Download RPi Imager on RPi" style="margin-top:0px;height:125px;">In the case of the second alternative when the Raspberry Pi4 is loaded, we long press (about 10seconds) the SHIFT key until the display shows the Raspberry Imager download on the screen.<br/><br/>At the end of the download, the Raspberry will restart and load the Imager onto the screen...<br/><br/>From there, the steps are the same as for 1. and 2. alternatives...<div align="right">1. Choose OS &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><img src="https://github.com/EchoInCloud/Extreme-Kit/blob/main/img/RaspberryPi4v8_onRPi_stp-02_choose-os.jpg?raw=true" align="right" alt="Choose OS" style="display:inline-block;margin-top:10px;height:125px;"><br/>We connect the sd card to the computer orRaspbery Pi. Following the steps shown in the images below, we select the boot image for usb and we prepare the sd card.</p>
<br/><br/>

<div align="center">
  <div>2. Select Utility Images &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Select Bootloader &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Select USB Boot &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
  <div><img src="https://github.com/EchoInCloud/Extreme-Kit/blob/main/img/RaspberryPi4v8_onRPi_stp-03_utilityImages.jpg?raw=true" alt="Utility Images" style="margin-top:0px;height:172px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="https://github.com/EchoInCloud/Extreme-Kit/blob/main/img/RaspberryPi4v8_onRPi_stp-04_bootloader.jpg?raw=true" alt="Bootloader" style="margin-top:0px;height:172px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="https://github.com/EchoInCloud/Extreme-Kit/blob/main/img/RaspberryPi4v8_onRPi_stp-05_usbBoot.jpg?raw=true" alt="USB Boot" style="margin-top:0px;height:172px;">
 </div>
</div>
<br/>
<div align="center">
  <div> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Choose Storage &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6. Select USB Drive/sdCard &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7. Write USB Bootloader to sdCard</div>
  <div><img src="https://github.com/EchoInCloud/Extreme-Kit/blob/main/img/RaspberryPi4v8_onRPi_stp-06_choose-storage.jpg?raw=true" alt="Choose Storage" style="margin-top:0px;height:172px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="https://github.com/EchoInCloud/Extreme-Kit/blob/main/img/RaspberryPi4v8_onRPi_stp-07_choose-sdCard.jpg?raw=true" alt="Choose sdCard" style="margin-top:0px;height:172px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="https://github.com/EchoInCloud/Extreme-Kit/blob/main/img/RaspberryPi4v8_onRPi_stp-08_write-sdCard.jpg?raw=true" alt="Write sdCard" style="margin-top:0px;height:172px;">
 </div>
</div>
<br/>
<p align="justify">When the writing is completed onto the sd card, we will restart the Raspberry Pi4 with the sd card WITHOUT SSD. After rebooting, the RPi4 will load the USB boot from the SD card and finalize the settings of the RPi4. Then a color display will appear, in most cases it is green. With that, we set the RPi4 to boot from the SSD. We shut down the Raspberry Pi4 and remove the SD card.<br/><br/>It is necessary to perform this operation only once.<br/><br/>- <i>Unless someone wants to reset boot settings to SD card for illogical reasons. In this case, based on the above steps, the SD card boot image should be written to the SD card, and the previous steps should be repeated...</i></p>
So, with these steps, we've properly pre-empted the Raspberry Pi4 for use with the SSD... Let speed be with us and our Vectors! :hugs:<br/>
We can use the sd card in the future to expand the storage space of our phone...<br/><br/>

#### **STEP 2** - How to install the Raspberry Pi OS to SSD<br/>

<p align="justify">Previously, we have prepared the Raspberry Pi4 for use with SSD, and have set up the Raspberry Pi4 for usbBoot. The next important step is to prepare the SSD for the Raspberry Pi4 as well. To do this, we connect the SSD to a laptop or computer and copy the factory files from it if we want. (may be good for something later)<br/><br/>After that, we delete the entire formatting along with the partition. We don't need to do anything else with the SSD. Everything else is done by RPi4... With that, we have prepared the SSD for the next steps.<br/><br/>We launch RPi4 again without SSD (and sd card). After loading, we long press and hold the SHIFT button as we did in the previous chapter. Raspberry Pi4 will re-download the imager boot image and re-initially. After that, it will load the Raspberry Imager, as it did before. 🙃<br/><br/>Once the nice red Imager has loaded again on RPi4, we connect the SSD to the Raspberry Pi4 and perform the following steps:</p>

<div align="center">

 </div>
</div>
<br/>
<p align="justify">It is important to properly fill in the options in the settings. For the wi-fi network, the router 2G channel NAME (SSID) is written and the password that the vectors use for the router. Set the same password as the router and type it again for Raspberry OS after "pi" username.<br/><br/>- <i>Yeeess.. it also connects to the router with Raspberry wireless and still has no hotspot function...</i></p>
<div align="center">

<p align="justify">Imager creates partitions and file systems on the non-partitioned SSD by extending it to the entire area of the SSD. After that, we do not need to do anything.</p>

<p align="justify"><img src="https://github.com/EchoInCloud/Extreme-Kit/blob/main/img/raspberry_ssh_consol.jpg?raw=true" align="right" alt="Choose OS" style="margin-top:0px;height:150px;">If you get a black screen for several minutes after installing the system, do not be scared. It occurs in rare cases. In this case, you need to connect to the Raspberry Pi via ssh from a computer or laptop using the following steps:<br/><br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; "SSH pi@HOSTNAME"<br/><br/>The hostname is "extremepod" if you followed this instructions.<br/>After pressing enter, you will receive a question. Type "yes" and press Enter. After that, the password will be requested and connected.<br/><br/><img src="https://github.com/EchoInCloud/Extreme-Kit/blob/main/img/raspberry_ssh_HDMI_config.jpg?raw=true" align="right" alt="Choose OS" style="margin-top:0px;height:250px;">After logging in to Raspberry, enter the following line:<br/><br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>sudo nano /boot/config.txt</b><br/><br/>Find the following line and delete the symbol "#" from the beginning: &nbsp; <b>#hdmi_force_hotplug=1</b><br/>After that, press <b>Ctrl + X </b>. Press "Y" and then enter.<br/><br/>Type this line and this will start the Raspberry Pi and turn on the HDMI output:<br/><br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>sudo reboot</b><br/><br/>The right one is the primary connector...</p>
<p align="justify"><img src="https://github.com/EchoInCloud/Extreme-Kit/blob/main/img/RaspberryPi4v8_onRPi_LAN-WIFI.jpg?raw=true" align="right" alt="Choose OS" style="margin-top:0px;height:150px;">We have tested several alternatives to the operating system for Raspberry Pi4. Unfortunately, the headless Raspberry OS (Lite 64) does not handle wireless properly. Even the presence of the required actions and files does not ensure the use of wireless and LAN. We also found a bug in Raspberry OS 64 Desktop. Do NOT use the command "sudo raspi-conf" or "sudo raspi-configure" in the consol and DO NOT run the built-in configuration by these commands. This results in the error that wireless is blocked and only reinstallation will solve the problem. If the steps above do not connect RPi4 to the router, the router will need to be restarted to redistribute the connections. So setting up the imager is enough...<br/><br/>We also tested linux distributions on RPi for Raspberry, but they failed in desktop management and display with continuous operation. The Raspberry Pi4 in our case should work NON-STOP with a scheduled reboot... not to mention memory usage. We need the memory, we don't feed it with the operating system... 🤑</p>
